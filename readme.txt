Displays all products from any site with Easy Digital Downloads installed

== Description ==
This plugin was built to give my users an easier way of watching and installing new products from my shop. This plugin uses the API built into Easy Digital Downloads. The user enters their own API key and are able to view all products. The plugin will scan to see if any of the listed products are installed, and indicate to the user if they are installed, along with the version.

To Come:
One click install from store.
